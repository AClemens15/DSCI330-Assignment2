This course will give students an overview of the issues related to the 
management of unstructured data, i.e. data not stored in a table or 
database. Sources of unstructured data include bodies of text, social 
media applications, images, and audio. In the process of exploring 
various forms of unstructured data, students will be exposed to new 
programming languages and tools that are useful for managing this type 
of data (e.g. Python and bash). Other topics covered in the course 
include web scraping, natural language processing, and manipulating 
images/videos/audio files. Prerequisites: DSCI 210 and CS 234, or 
instructorÂ¿s permission. Offered alternate years.
